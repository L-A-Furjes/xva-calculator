# Credit Configuration for xVA Calculation Engine
# Contains hazard rates and recovery assumptions

credit:
  # Counterparty credit parameters
  counterparty:
    # Hazard rate in basis points (per annum)
    # ~120 bps implies ~5.8% 5Y cumulative PD
    hazard_rate_bps: 120

    # Recovery rate (1 - LGD)
    recovery_rate: 0.40

    # Credit rating (informational)
    rating: "BBB"

  # Own credit parameters (for DVA)
  own:
    # Our hazard rate (typically lower if we're a bank)
    hazard_rate_bps: 100

    # Our recovery rate
    recovery_rate: 0.40

    # Our rating
    rating: "A"

# Derived LGD values (for reference):
# counterparty_lgd = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 (60%)
# own_lgd = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 (60%)
